# DBolt

Another fork of the [boltdb](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt), kv-DB for main stream cloud services and clients

## Arch & OS

Though golang supports all in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/build/syslist.go

But we just pick several main stream ones

Arch: i386, amd64, arm, arm64
OS: windows, linux, darwin(macOS)
